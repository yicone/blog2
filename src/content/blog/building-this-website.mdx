I recently decided to revitalize my personal website, which had been neglecting for quite some time. The goal was to create a fast, maintainable, and modern site where I could share my thoughts and projects.

## The Stack

Here is the tech stack I chose for this regeneration:

- **[Astro](https://astro.build/):** The web framework for content-driven websites. I upgraded to the latest **Astro v5**, which introduces the powerful Content Layer API.
- **[UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/):** The instant on-demand atomic CSS engine. It's incredibly fast and flexible.
- **[DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/):** A component library for Tailwind CSS (which UnoCSS supports via preset). It provides beautiful pre-made components like the navbar and cards.
- **[Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/):** For hosting. It's fast, free for personal use, and integrates perfectly with GitHub.

## Why Astro v5?

Astro's "Island Architecture" is a game-changer for performance. It strips away unused JavaScript, shipping mostly HTML to the browser.

With **Astro v5**, the new **Content Layer API** makes managing content collections even easier. I can define my blog posts using a simple schema and load them from the file system using the glob loader.

```typescript
// src/content.config.ts
import { defineCollection, z } from 'astro:content';
import { glob } from 'astro/loaders';

const blog = defineCollection({
  loader: glob({ pattern: '**/*.{md,mdx}', base: './src/content/blog' }),
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    pubDate: z.coerce.date()
    // ...
  })
});
```

## Styling with UnoCSS & DaisyUI

I used to struggle with CSS, but utility-first CSS changed that. UnoCSS takes it a step further by generating only the CSS you actually use.

DaisyUI adds a layer of abstraction on top, giving me semantic class names like `btn`, `card`, and `navbar`. This speeds up development significantly without sacrificing customization.

## Deployment

Deploying to Cloudflare Pages was a breeze. I simply connected my GitHub repository, and Cloudflare automatically detects the Astro framework. Now, every time I push to `main`, my site is automatically rebuilt and deployed globally.

## What's Next?

I plan to add more content, including my tech radar and some more deep dives into the technologies I use daily. Stay tuned!
